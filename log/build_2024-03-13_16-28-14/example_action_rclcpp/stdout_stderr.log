[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findrobot_control_interfaces.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "robot_control_interfaces", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "robot_control_interfaces" with any of the following names:

    robot_control_interfacesConfig.cmake
    robot_control_interfaces-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "robot_control_interfaces" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "robot_control_interfaces_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "robot_control_interfaces" provides
  a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
